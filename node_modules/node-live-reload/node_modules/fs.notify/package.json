  "readme": "# fs.notify\n\n**fs.notify** was born out of annoyance. The state of the fs#watch API in\nNode.js is sad, it assumes that you as developer build your own abstraction on\ntop of it, because it basically can't guarantee file names or that it even works\non all platforms. And all other \"simple\" watching modules had to much bugs and\nperformance issues. oh and it pleases my\n[NIH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) syndrome.\n\n## tl;dr\n\n**fs.notify** is file watching module for Node.js that doesn't suck hairy monkey\nballs and actually works.\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar Notify = require('fs.notify');\n\nvar files = [\n  '/path/to/file',\n  '/file/i/want/to/watch'\n];\n\nvar notifications = new Notify(files);\nnotifications.on('change', function (file) {\n  console.log('file changed');\n});\n\n// if you want to add more files you can use the\nnotifications.add([path, morepaths]);\n\n// kill everything\nnotifications.close();\n```\n\n## LICENSE (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Observe.it (http://observe.it) <opensource@observe.it>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: \n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
